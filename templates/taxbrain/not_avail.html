    We are unable to display the results for this simulation. We apologize for the inconvenience and are working to
    provide a satisfactory solution for displaying or recovering results created using older versions of
    PolicyBrain. Here is one option for re-creating your results:
</h2>

<h3>
    Go to the <a href="{{edit_href}}">input page</a> and
    re-submit your parameters using the current version of PolicyBrain. Note that for older runs
    some parameters may have been deprecated. We recommend
    <a href="https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/tree/{{taxcalc_version}}"> Tax-Calculator's</a> documentation for alternative parameter choices.
</h3>

<h3>
    The Tax-Calculator package may have more options for re-creating results with the exact version of
    Tax-Calculator used in this simulation. For more details, please <a href="https://www.ospc.org/hello/"> contact the OSPC team. </a>
